# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
These is a famous competition of kaggle.
The dataset can be found on Kaggle.
Done feature enginnering using imputer and selecting some important features only.
For solving this problem i have used basic machine learning model such as linear regression and random forest to predict the house price.
I also used XGB regressor and find least mean absolute error with it.
